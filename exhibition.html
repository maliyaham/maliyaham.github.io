			<p> “Lungs” is a memorial to the 4,500 slave laborers that worked in Hall A of the former Deutschen Waffen und Munitionsfabriken A.G. during the Second World War (now the main exhibition hall of ZKM). By computing the vital lung capacity of these forced workers, the program emits their last breath of air.
The project is based on ways of bridging the gap between the perception of data and social experience.
 The aim is to take computer records of local events or communities that have been reduced or demeaned to the status of information and to allow the people to re-experience their own value.
 By having people experience these things physically, it can cause a visceral reaction and a better comprehension of these workers' excruciating circumstances.
 The term “Lungs” refers to the technique of giving a database a pair of lungs by calculating the human lung capacity that is represented by the individuals in that dataset and “breathing out” the result through an audio system. 
</p>
			<p>This method of crossing a software machine with a human machine was here implemented as a software memorial to the slave labor that worked in the ex-munitions factory in Karlsruhe, Germany.
YoHa aimed to examine the troubling way IBM supplied the Nazis with technology aiding in the tabulation of information about and processing of the slave workers.
YoHa used computer records that had seemingly been reduced to data or dry statistical information to produce a more human experience and understanding of a social atrocity and its basis in data processing.
</p>
			<p> YoHa’s software would display each entry from the original database, representing statistics pertaining. Then, it would calculate the approximate lung capacity of each victim using their height, weight, and age, and trigger the playback of a unique recorded sound of a human breath.
Lungs builds on Harwood’s earlier code poem, London.pl (2001), in which he adapted William Blake’s poem London as a nonfunctional perl routine that apparently calculated the last breaths of children who died in the city since 1792, when the first version of the poem was written.
