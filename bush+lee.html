      "As We May Think" is a thought-provoking essay written by Vannevar Bush. In this essay he articulates a vision of a future in which technology is harnessed to enhance human knowledge and creativity. The essay is remarkable for its insights into the potential of technology and its anticipation of many of the developments that have come to define the digital age. An important aspect of Bush's essay is his recognition of the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in order to fully realize the potential of technology. He argues that progress in science and technology depends on the ability of individuals from different fields to work together and to share their knowledge and expertise.
      "Long Live the Web" is an essay by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, in which he reflects on the current state of the Web and his vision for its future. The essay is notable for its passionate defense of an open and free Web, and its recognition of the challenges that threaten this vision. One of the key themes in Berners-Lee's essay is the importance of maintaining the Web as an open and neutral platform that is accessible to all. He argues that this openness and accessibility are essential to the Web's success, and warns of the dangers of allowing powerful corporations or governments to control or restrict access to the Web. 
      This directly correlates to Bush’s idea of collaboration. Berners-Lee argues that the Web has enabled unprecedented levels of communication and information sharing, and that this has led to new opportunities for innovation and problem-solving. Despite Bush’s essay being written way before the web had been developed, both put an emphasis on collaboration and creativity for the future success of technology.
