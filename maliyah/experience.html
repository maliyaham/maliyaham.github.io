			<p> The main exhibition hall is located in the historic former munitions factory, right where 4500 slave workers labored during WWII. YoHa wrote software that would display the data associated with each worker, calculate their estimated lung capacity, then emit a sound that would displace an equivalent volume of air onto the face of a seated viewer in the gallery. 

Many of the entries have still not been historically reappraised even to this day, nor have the individual fates of laborers been appropriately acknowledged.

			<p>My own experience with this work is that I think that this software memorial is so impactful because as a participant in this art installation, you're directly faced with the reality of how arduously these people lived. You are experiencing a tortured person's last breath through technology and software. Even reading about it sent chills down my spine. Though you know the breath that is emitted from the machine is a recreation of that person's lung capacity, I am sure that the feeling must still be shocking. To me, technology can feel like it is entirely out of our physical realm, however when you incorporate physicalities into the display of its data, as humans I believe that we cannot help but connect to that. It is one thing to look at a bunch of numbers and words on a screen, but when that is then translated into something that you can feel physically, the response is undoubtedly gutting.

			<p> This art installation captivates 4,500 slave workers’ lung capacity during World War 2. It was constructed to gain the attention of the horrible acts that were committed during the war. I think it's fascinating for YoHa to use technology to exhibit the breaths of the slave workers, as Nazis used IBM computers during the war to document their act. I'm sure anyone who comes across this artwork, would feel nothing but sorrow. Just to even think something so meaningful exists, I can’t help but wonder the torments slave workers faced during World War 2.
